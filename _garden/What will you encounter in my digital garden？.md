# What will you encounter in my digital garden?

Explicitly, you will see the following:
- notes which are unfinished
- links to notes which don't yet exist

Some notes will be about ideas.

Some will be opinions.

Some will be autobiographical notes.

Some will be about other people, although this will be:
- only people who have a public profile
- generally only people I have (and can express) positive opinions about
- people who write about ideas I find interesting and wish to comment on

It's basically [[a digital garden as a second brain|all the thoughts swirling around in my head]].
