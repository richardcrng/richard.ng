# What will you encounter in my digital garden?

It's easy to get lost in my digital garden. I'm working on a [[digital garden - field guide for visitors|field guide]], but in the interim, here's some intel on what you can expect.

Explicitly, you will see the following:
- fragmented thoughts that are not well-formed
- tentative opinions that [[changing opinions|could get radically changed]]
- passages of text that are randomly incomplete
- links to random notes that don't exist, [[example private note|like this example private note]]

Some notes will be about ideas on wide-ranging topics - from tech, to politics, to the totally humdrum.

Some will be autobiographical notes - deep navel gazing with a side of stream-of-consciousness.

Some will be about organisations and people, although this will be:
- only organisations and people who have a public profile
- generally only organisations and people that I have (and can express) positive opinions about (or can be politely constructive about)

It's basically [[a digital garden as a second brain|all the thoughts swirling around in my head]].
