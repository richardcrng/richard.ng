# No-code

No code is sometimes set up in opposition to [[Should you learn how to codeï¼Ÿ|learning how to code]] - *oh, who needs coding, it's no code that's the future!*

I don't think they're opposed, though.

I write code and [[coding education|help others to learn how to code]], find both of those things rewarding and meaningful, *and* I really enjoy using certain no-code tools.

No code tools I love:
- [[Notion|Notion]] - great for flexible and visually appealing content and data organisation (it plays a role in [[website tech stack|how I build this personal website]])
- [[Airtable|Airtable]] - great for quick and easy structured databases
