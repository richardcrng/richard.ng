# Permanent Beta

**Permanent beta** is a term from [[Reid Hoffman|Reid Hoffman]] and [[Ben Casnocha]]'s co-authored book, *[[The Startup of You|The Startup Of You]]*.

They use it as a dictum to continued personal growth and change:

> Finished ought to be an F-word for all of us. We are all works in progress. Each day presents an opportunity to learn more, do more, be more, grow more in our lives and careers. Keeping your career in permanent beta forces you to acknowledge that you have bugs, that there’s new development to do on yourself, that you will need to adapt and evolve. But it’s still a mind-set brimming with optimism because it celebrates the fact that you have the power to improve yourself and, as important, improve the world around you.
