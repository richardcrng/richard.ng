# Meritocracy

Meritocracy seems at first like it should be an obviously uncontroversial thing. As noted by people like [[David Goodhart|David Goodhart]] (in *[[Head Hand Heart|Head Hand Heart]]*) and [[Michael Sandel|Michael Sandel]] (in *[[The Tyranny of Merit]]*), it's a concept embraced by both the political left and right - although they might dispute the content of the definition, they agree that it is desirable.

It had never occurred to me that meritocracy could be a controversial thing until I read these two aforementioned books ([[Head Hand Heart|Head Hand Heart]] and [[The Tyranny of Merit|The Tyranny of Merit]]), and I am now [[increasingly thinking|increasingly thinkign]] that it is a problematic ideal.
