# Personal career narrative

This is a personal [[career narratives|career narrative]].

My career path has been an eclectic one.

You can see how I tell the story [elsewhere on this site](https://richard.ng/work) but a lot of things have happened to me [[serendipity|by accident]].

Here's an informal sketch of how it happened:
- by nature, I was a [[generalism|generalist]] at school
- I decided that [[PPE|PPE]] was a natural extension of this as a generalist
- I originally thought that [[traditional career paths|consulting]] would be a suitable extension of this
- but realised my passion for [[education|education]] and ended up doing [[Teach First|Teach First]]
- discovered that the state school system is maybe not the place for me and fell into [[edtech|edtech]]
- ended up in a niche in [[coding education|coding education]] and [[startups|startups]]
