# The fetishisation of knowledge work

As a relatively conventional [[knowledge worker|knowledge worker]] myself, I'm going on an interesting journey in considering whether it's overly-fetishised by society.

It's a thought planted by readings like:
- [[Head Hand Heart|Head Hand Heart]] by [[David Goodhart|David Goodhart]]
- [[The Tyranny of Merit|The Tyranny of Merit]] by [[Michael Sandel|Michael Sandel]]
- [[Brexitland|Brexitland]] by Maria Sobolewska and Robert Ford

Some things that I *don't* believe:
- knowledge work is of no value
- knowledge work is intrinsically snobbish
- knowledge work ought not to be a source of pride to people

But I am considering whether, as a *society*, we are overly tilted towards a position where knowledge workers monopolise social esteem.
