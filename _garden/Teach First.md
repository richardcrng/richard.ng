Teach First is the British equivalent of [[Teach For America|Teach for America]]:
- takes university graduates (and some career-changers - although not as purpose-built for late career changers as [[Now Teach|Now Teach]])
- places them in a school serving a socioeconomically deprived community for 2 years
