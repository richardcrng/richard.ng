# Twitter

I'm still figuring out how to get the most out of Twitter.

It seems like a big time sink, lots of noise - sometimes, people making noise and not necessarily getting much done - but I know some people seem to get a lot out of it, so I'm still weighing up whether I should invest time in it or not.
