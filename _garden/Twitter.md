# Twitter

I'm still figuring out how to get the most out of Twitter. (I [[my Twitter|do have an account]], but I don't regularly consume or create Tweets.)

It seems like a big time sink, lots of noise - sometimes, people making noise and not necessarily getting much done - but I know some people seem to get a lot out of it, so I'm still weighing up whether I should invest time in it or not.

One of the things I find difficult about Twitter is a sense of inhibition I have on there - I feel an enormous pressure to e.g. try to get loads of likes/retweets on anything. [[Performative vs non-performative writing|It feels performative]] and activates my [[perfectionism|perfectionist]] tendencies.

On the other hand, I'm finding creating [[My Digital Garden (Home)|my own digital garden]] - where things are actively unfinished, where it's entirely my own space, where I have control over the connections I make - far more freeing.
