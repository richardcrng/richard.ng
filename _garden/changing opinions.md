# Changing opinions

It sometimes seems to me that Western culture doesn't easily permit people to change their opinions.

This is harmful, I think - when people have problematic opinions, we should make it easy for them to change them and not previous things looming over them (versus making them double-down defensively).

(N.B. this is focused on changing opinions vs recanting behaviour - when you have committed acts of harm against people, that's different to "I had a silly opinion and now I've changed it")
