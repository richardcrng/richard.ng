# Open Source

I try to **open-source** (e.g. making source code publicly available) my work whenever possible, for a few reasons:

1. *Culture* - the culture of open-source appeals to me (building off others' work, letting others build on your work)
2. *Visibility* - open-sourcing work makes it easier for your work to get noticed (related to [[learning in public|learning in public]])
3. *Accessibility* - I'm not in the business of jealously guarding what I've learned; I like helping others!

In that spirit, the code for this website is actually entirely open-source! It's available through [[GitHub|GitHub]], in [this repository](https://github.com/richardcrng/richard.ng).

I also have a small but growing note on the technologies, libraries and tools [[website tech stack|that I used to build this site]].
