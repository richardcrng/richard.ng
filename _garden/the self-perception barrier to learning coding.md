# The self-perception barrier to learning coding

There is notoriously a big [[impostor syndrome|impostor syndrom]] problem amongst those who are learning how to code - and so an even bigger amongst those who don't even try to learn how to code.

This is also a problem when it comes to [[diversity and inclusion|diversity]] in tech.

I have some lived experience on this. Before I started learning, I think I had the mental picture of [[black and white thinking|two types of people]]:
1. coders: someone like Mark Zuckerberg (a straight white geeky male who has been hacking away since they were about 11)
2. non-coders: normal people; the rest of us

However, through [[serendipity|sheer chance]], I discovered that learning to code is much more accessible than I had thought.
