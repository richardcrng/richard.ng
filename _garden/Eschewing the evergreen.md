# Eschewing the evergreen

[[evergreen notes|Evergreen notes]] are an appealing concept.

I deliberately work under a "non-evergreen" mindset, though (which I think is more to do with terminology of 'evergreen' rather than the actual definition).

For me, the term 'evergreen' has connotations of 'should always be green (i.e. full of vitality and bloom)', whereas my digital garden is explicitly [[publicising unfinished notes|full of things which are short stubs]].

This is important for me to consciously adopt as a principle because it overcomes my [[perfectionism]].

[[Maggie Appleton|Maggie Appleton]] has [a taxonomy of notes](https://maggieappleton.com/evergreens):
- seedlings
- budding
- evergreen

which I'm attracted to, partly because it could also serve a nice way of [[declaring epistemic status and effort in a digital garden|declaring epistemic status and effort]] for each note, as suggested in [[Shawn Wang|Shawn Wang]]'s [[Digital Garden Terms of Service|Digital Garden Terms of Service]] (which I'm intending to base [[digital garden - field guide for visitors|my own garden field guide]] off).

(It's also, clearly, a lovely thematic fit with 'digital garden' and 'evergreen' notes!)
