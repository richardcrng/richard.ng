# Philosophy, Politics and Economics

I studied PPE at Oxford.

I think that the UK has a bit of a problematic relationship with the PPE degree, mostly through politics - e.g. [this Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/feb/23/ppe-oxford-university-degree-that-rules-britain) really drives it home in the opening passages.

It's been famously critiqued by Dominic Cummings in [one of his blog posts](https://dominiccummings.com/the-odyssean-project-2/):

> Courses such as Politics, Philosophy and Economics (and economics in general) do not train political leaders well. They encourage superficial bluffing, misplaced confidence (e.g. many graduates leave with little or no idea about fundamental issues concerning mathematical models of the economy (cf. p.21-5 & 214-229)), and they do not train people to make decisions in complex organisations.

I do actually think it's a good degree, though... (and will write more on this later)
