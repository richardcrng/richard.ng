I interpret Chesterton's fence as a cautionary warning about change and reform.

It's attributed to G.K. Chesterton (reputedly [a polymath](https://fs.blog/2020/03/chestertons-fence/), although I know little about the person myself).

> There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, "I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away." To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: "If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.
