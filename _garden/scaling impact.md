# Scaling impact

- One of my main motivators is [[impact on society as a personal motivation|positively impacting society]] (particularly in fields of [[education|education]] and [[diversity and inclusion|D&I]])
- I'm very interested in the intersection of 'social impact' and 'scalable business models'

It's not, though, an 'optimise for overal magnitude of impact' sort of thing - as a rudimentary and simplified example, I'd >10x prefer to improve the lives of 7,000 people by 10% than to improve the lives of 7 billion people by 0.001% even though a narrowly arithmetic view would suggest my 10x preference ought to go in the other direction.

It's something like "make a (positive and) meaningful difference to the lives as many as possible" for me, I think.
