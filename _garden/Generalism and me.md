# Generalism and me

I consider myself quite a bit of a [[generalism|generalist]].

But, similar terms I *wouldn't* ascribe to myself:
- *jack-of-all-trades* - connatations of being mediocre at everything (demeaning)
- *polymath* - connations of being exceptional at everything (arrogant)

(although if somebody wanted to call me a polymath, I'd be flattered and take the compliment...)

I consider myself a generalist because I've found that I've done a wide range of things [[my career path|in my career]] [[side projects|and my side projects]]:
- [[storytelling|storytelling]]
- [[writing|writing]]
- [[public speaking|public speaking]]
- [[coding|coding]]

and I enjoy all of them (and consider myself above-average in all of them, too).

It's one of the reasons why I chose to study [[PPE|PPE]] as a degree - my favourite subject at school was actually [[mathematics|maths]], but I wasn't sure I loved it enough to study *just* maths for three/four years - I knew that variety was valuable to me.
