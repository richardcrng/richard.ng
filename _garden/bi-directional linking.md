# Bi-directional linking

Bi-directional linking is a way of building richer relationships between notes and documents such that, when A links to B, B notes A as a 'backlink'.

[[Maggie Appleton|Maggie Appleton]] (of course) has [[Maggie Appleton's Short History of Bi-Directional Links|a typically *lovely* illustrated note]] which is well worth a read.
