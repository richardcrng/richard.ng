# The fund returner mental model

One of the interesting ways in which [[Included VC|Included VC]] has shaped me is how I now apply the [[venture capital|VC]] ideas 'fund returners' as a more general mental model in other parts of my life - like projects and people.

For example, on people - [[investing in your professional network|I try to cast my net wide with connections I make and people that I support]].

- Lots of these will probably not go anywhere or lead to any significant gain for myself. That's okay! I've helped someone and had a nice conversation, hopefully?
- A small fraction of these will hopefully have outsized and disproportionate impact - enough to potentially justify, by themselves, the time investment made in connecting more widely with a bunch of people
