# My Teach First experience

I think Teach First is doing a really great thing and I know lots of people who've had incredible experiences with it.

For me, it wasn't great - although I'm certainly glad I tried and it proved an important catalyst in the [[my career path|eccentric career route that I've taken]].

I would say that there was a damaging interaction between two things:
1. My youthful tendencies towards [[idealism|idealism]]
2. A [[hero complex|hero complex]] which was [[the Teach First hero complex|tacitly encouraged by Teach First marketing]]
