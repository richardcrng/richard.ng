# Perfectionism

I used to think that perfectionism was about "always sweating the small details on everything" - which I didn't identify with at all; I have a very strongly internalised sense of [[the Pareto principle|the Pareto principle]]. (Either I care about something a lot, or I don't really care about it at all.)

However, I've since readjusted my notion of the word to encompass 'high standards (in a way that can be unhelpful)', which ([[CBT and me|as I learned through CBT]]) is something which *does* apply to me.

It's actually one of the things I'm finding most liberating about curating [[My Digital Garden (Home)|this digital garden of mine]] - it's maybe the first time that I've felt really licensed to just throw stuff at the wall and not worry about it being amazing.
