# Investing in your professional network

My relationship with 'networking' - as word and a concept - has evolved quite a lot.

Originally, I was repelled by the word and everything I thought it stood for:
- it seemed to run counter to ideas of [[meritocracy|meritocracy]] - all about playing a game on [[person-luck|knowing the right people]] rather than actually being the best
- it seemed dehumanising and inauthentic - talking to someone not out of any genuine interest in them, but out of a hope that they will be useful to you in some way

I've [[changing opinions|come to view]] it rather differently. I still think the word 'networking' has some unpleasant connotations, but I have a pretty positive relationship with the concept of 'investing in your professional network' - both _growing_ and _deepening_ it.

I view growing my network as being part of an [[permanent beta|ongoing endeavour]] in [[finding your tribe|finding my tribe]] - it's an empowering act of discovery, expression and connection.
