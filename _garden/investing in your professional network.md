# Investing in your professional network

My relationship with 'networking' - as word and a concept - has evolved quite a lot.

Originally, I was repelled by the word and everything I thought it stood for:
- it seemed to run counter to ideas of [[meritocracy|meritocracy]] - all about playing a game on [[person-luck|knowing the right people]] rather than actually being the best
- it seemed dehumanising and inauthentic - talking to someone not out of any genuine interest in them, but out of a hope that they will be useful to you in some way
