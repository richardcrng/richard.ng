# Traditional career paths

There seem to be essentially 4 traditional career paths for [[higher education|graduates]]:

1. Consulting
2. Banking
3. Law
4. Accounting

with Recruitment also popping up as a very-present option.

Partly through confirmation bias of my own path, I've come to believe that there is significantly under-represented opportunity available in [[technology|tech]] and [[startups|startups]] for graduates.

(Although I am also increasingly sceptical on [[higher education|higher education]] as a mass-vehicle)
