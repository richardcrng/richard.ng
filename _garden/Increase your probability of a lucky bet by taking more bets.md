# Increase your probability of a lucky bet by taking more bets

This is a thought which has been planted / nurtured from a few different sources:

- [[Reid Hoffman|Reid Hoffman]]'s *[[The Startup of You|The Startup of You]]*
- the notion of [[person-luck|person-luck]] (or 'who-luck') from [[Stephen Millard|Stephen Millard]] (co-founder of [[Included VC|Included VC]])
- [[the fund returner mental model|the fund returner mental model]]

## From *[[The Startup of You|The Startup of You]]*:

> It’s easy in hindsight to attribute breakthrough career opportunities to a master plan. “And then, since I knew Nancy would be crucial to my success, I decided to randomly bump into her at a party.… ” Yeah, right. What more often happens is that you stumble upon the person or idea without specifically intending to. The key, then, is to raise the likelihood that you stumble upon something valuable—namely, by courting good randomness and seeing the opportunities that reveal themselves.

> As entrepreneur Bo Peabody says, “The best way to ensure that lucky things happen is to make sure a lot of things happen.” Make things happen, and in the long run, you’ll design your own serendipity, and make your own opportunities.
