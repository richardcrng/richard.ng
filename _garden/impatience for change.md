# Impatience for change

One of my double-edged qualities is an impatience for change that I have.

It means that, for example, I can probably fall victim to the mistake warned about in [[Chesterton's fence|Chesterton's fence]].

It's difficult, though - because I'm a very [[on being opinionated|opinionated]] [[conviction|conviction]]-driven person. If I believe that something needs changing, I believe it very strongly.

It's one of the reasons why I favour [[startups|startups]] - I am a bit [[my allergy to bureaucracy|allergic to bureaucracy]].
