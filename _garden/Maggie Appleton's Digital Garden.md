[[Maggie Appleton|Maggie]]'s [[digital garden|digital garden]] is *beautiful* - which is unsurprising perhaps given her illustration background.

I also love how she's categorised her notes into a taxonomy depending on how cultivated they are. I'm currently deliberately [[Eschewing the evergreen|eschewing the 'evergreen' label]], but the categorisation / labelling is likely something I will return to.
