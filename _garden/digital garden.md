# Digital Gardens

I'm [[changing opinions|coming to think]] that a digital garden is best understood through a *philosophy* rather than through *artefacts* or *process*.

Whilst [[philosophy of the digital garden|I'm developing my own personal philosophy]], I think there are commonalities across [[digital gardens that I like|other digital gardens]]:

1. **Dynamic, not static**. A digital garden should evolve and grow over time: write, revisit, edit.
2.  **Through the rabbit hole**. Visitors should be able to get lost ([and tweet about enjoying this as an experience!](https://twitter.com/BrunoArine/status/1330874011870523395)).
3.  **Above all, personal**. This is like Orwell's [sixth rule of the English language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_and_the_English_Language#Remedy_of_Six_Rules): you should sooner break any of the earlier guidelines than do something which feels inauthentic to yourself.

This leads to things like:
- [[bi-directional linking|bi-directionality]]

[[Maggie Appleton|Maggie Appleton]] has some really excellent resources and thought-pieces on digital gardening:
1. The best place to start is her [[Maggie Appleton's Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden|'Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden']]
2. A follow-up list of resources for the interested is her [[Maggie Appleton's Digital Gardeners repository|digital gardeners repository]]
