# Digital Gardens

I'm [[changing opinions|coming to think]] that a digital garden is best understood through a *philosophy* rather than through *artefacts* or *process*.

Whilst [[philosophy of the digital garden|I'm developing my own personal philosophy]], I think there are commonalities across [[digital gardens that I like|other digital gardens]].
