# Notion

I use [Notion](https://notion.so) for notes and productivity.

It's a very different note-taking style to [[Obsidian|Obsidian]] and [[digital garden|digital gardening]] - more structured.

Things I really like about Notion:
- a lovely frictionless writing experience
- rollup properties on relations between tables
- nesting pages arbitrarily deep
