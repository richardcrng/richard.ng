# Why I use Obsidian for personal note-taking

There are lots of [[notetaking tools|notetaking tools]] and [[personal knowledge management|personal knowledge management]] systems out there.

I've chosen [[Obsidian|Obsidian]] for [[My Digital Garden (Home)|my digital garden]] - most of the notes you see here are written in the Obsidian desktop app.

However, I have also considered each of the following:
- [[Notion|Notion]] (although I don't use it for my digital garden, I use it in other ways in [[website tech stack|building this personal site]])
- [[RemNote|RemNote]]
- [[Roam Research|Roam Research]]

and thought I would articulate why I've ended up choosing Obsidian.

## 1. Obsidian is local-first

This, for me, is the ultimate killer feature that leads me to Obsidian (although there are other supporting reasons below).

With Obsidian, my notes are just local [[markdown|markdown]] files on my computer, which I can do anything with.

### I can *opt-in* to syncing...
- I could sync them between machines via some cloud storage e.g. Google Drive (I don't)
- I could store them in a [[GitHub|GitHub]] repo (I do - along with [[website tech stack|the rest of this website's source code]])

### ... and maintain the peace-of-mind of full file control
Since my files are fully local, I don't have to worry about them:
- being stuck behind a paywall if pricing plans change
- being inaccessible if some other company's servers go down

## 2. Obsidian is git-friendly

As a consequence of being local-first, Obsidian is [[git|git]]-friendly - which means that I can [[version control|version control]] my notes and use the [[GitHub|GitHub]] API.

## 3. Obsidian is just markdown

Because Obsidian is just [[markdown|markdown]], my notes are:
- easy to write and author
- pluggable into an existing markdown ecosystem
