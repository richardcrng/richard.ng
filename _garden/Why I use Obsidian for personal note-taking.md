# Why I use Obsidian for personal note-taking

There are lots of [[notetaking tools|notetaking tools]] and [[personal knowledge management|personal knowledge management]] systems out there.

I've chosen [[Obsidian|Obsidian]] for [[My Digital Garden (Home)|my digital garden]] - most of the notes you see here are written in the Obsidian desktop app.

However, I have also considered each of the following:
- [[Notion|Notion]] (although I don't use it for my digital garden, I use it in other ways in [[website tech stack|building this personal site]])
- [[RemNote|RemNote]]
- [[Roam Research|Roam Research]]

and thought I would articulate why I've ended up choosing Obsidian.
