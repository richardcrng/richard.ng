# Produce half-baked notes

In the early stages of my digital garden, I'm leaving a lot of notes that are incredibly half-baked - to be generous!

Lots of them are actually placeholder notes. (See: [[What will you encounter in my digital gardenï¼Ÿ|my ontology of digital garden notes]])

This helps me [[drawing connections|draw connections]] more easily, which is a very satisfying endeavour - just spew the notes out as atoms, and focus on the connections rather than the atoms themselves.
