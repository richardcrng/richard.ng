# Building stuff

I really like building stuff.

I find it very motivating when you do something which has concrete outputs - the satisfying ability to be able to point at something and think "I did that! I built that! This thing wouldn't exist without me!"

I've realised that this is possibly something missing from the debate on [[Should you learn how to codeï¼Ÿ|learning how to code]] - yes, it's a skill which can get you a great career with a good salary, but _it's also just fun to build stuff_!
