# Reid Hoffman

Someone whose books I have enjoyed a lot, in particular [[The Startup of You|The Startup of You]].

There's a fascinating piece, [[10,000 Hours with Reid Hoffman - What I Learned|10,000 Hours with Reid Hoffman]], which is written by Reid's former Chief of Staff and co-author, [[Ben Casnocha|Ben Casnocha]].

Reid originally has a [background in philosophy](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/reid-hoffman-network-philosopher) - [[PPE|kinda like me]]! - so I also am positively predisposed to him for that.
