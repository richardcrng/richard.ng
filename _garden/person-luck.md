# Person-luck

Person-luck is about 'getting lucky' in a specific way - by knowing the right people.

This has an empowering and disempowering interpretation.

The disempowering interpretation: the world is driven by [[nepotism vs networking|nepotism]], where the rich and powerful favour their friends. It's unfair and stacked against you. You should give up.

The empowering interpretation: you can *make yourself more lucky* by [[investing in your professional network|connecting with more people]].

I tend to prefer the empowering interpretation.
