**Riduce** is an [[open-source|open-source]] [[JavaScript|JavaScript]]/[[TypeScript|TypeScript]] [[state management|state management]] library that I've written and published - [source code available here](https://github.com/richardcrng/riduce), with [a separate documentation website](https://riduce.vercel.app).

I use it in parts of this website, e.g. [to manage search state in every garden note](https://github.com/richardcrng/richard.ng/blob/main/components/GardenNote/GardenNote.tsx).
