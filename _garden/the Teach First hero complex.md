# The Teach First hero complex

These thoughts reflect my personal experience - not one that is necessarily standard for all people (and, at a cursory glance now, looks like it might apply less to [[Teach First|Teach First]] in the current day than it did [[My Teach First experience|when I did Teach First]]).

Essentially, I think that there were a few things that I didn't do well when I was doing Teach First:
- I was too [[idealism|idealistic]]
- I was too much of a [[perfectionism|perfectionist]]
- I had a lot of [[black and white thinking|black and white thinking]]

So I definitely take responsibility for my shortcomings in all of those things.

I think I wasn't *helped* by a latent [[hero complex|hero complex]] which, at the very least, Teach First didn't *discourage* - and I would say, actively *encouraged* - in their marketing.

I went into my school with a (faulty) narrative running through my head that *I* was *single-handedly* going to *change the lives* of the kids, and pull them out of socioeconomic disadvantage into meteoric success (by which I probably had in mind a [[knowledge worker|knowledge worker]]'s image of [[conventional success|conventional success]] - [[higher education|university]] then a [[traditional career paths|traditional career path]]).
