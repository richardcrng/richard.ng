# Accepting an error rate as a cost of speed

A wonderful quote from [[10,000 Hours with Reid Hoffman - What I Learned|10,000 Hours with Reid Hoffman: What I Learned]]:

> If you move quickly, there’ll be mistakes borne of haste. If you’re a manager and care seriously about speed, you’ll need to tell your people you’re wiling to accept the tradeoffs. Reid did this with me. We agreed I was going to make judgment calls on a range of issues on his behalf without checking with him. He told me, “In order to move fast, I expect you’ll make some foot faults. I’m okay with an error rate of 10-20% — times when I would have made a different decision in a given situation – if it means you can move fast.”

Speaks to my [[impatience for change|impatience for change]] and is a counterpoint against [[Chesterton's fence|Chesterton's fence]]!
