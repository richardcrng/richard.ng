# Obsidian

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is what I use to author the notes in my digital garden.

You can read more about my choice here: [[Why I use Obsidian for personal note-taking|why I use Obsidian for personal note-taking]].

I like Obsidian because it lets me write notes in [[markdown|markdown]], keep them locally and version control through [[GitHub|GitHub]].
