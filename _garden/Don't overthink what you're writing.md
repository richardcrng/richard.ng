# Don't overthink what you're writing

My normal writing process involves lots of thought and backspacing ("oh that actually could be worded better").

When I'm writing my digital garden, I'm actively trying to avoid backspacing - seeing it as a random dump of ideas in my head, almost like stream of consciousness.

This makes it less reader friendly (hence the need for a [[digital garden - field guide for visitors|field guide]], probably) but it's actually quite a nice writing experience.

So, is it selfish? Undoubtedly - but [[digital garden motivations|I'm doing this mostly for myself]], anyway, so that seems totally appropriate in this instance.
