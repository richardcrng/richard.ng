# Capture things in your digital garden before linking away to them

Often, I'll find that I mention an organisation, idea or book in a way where I would have historically linked directly to some external reference point ([[Twitter|Twitter]]/[[LinkedIn|LinkedIn]]/[[Wikipedia|Wikipedia]] etc), for people to read more.

In my digital garden, I'm preferring to try to capture this as a note first (e.g. I've done it above with Twitter, LinkedIn and Wikipedia), although I will intend to ultimately link from there to the external resource.

I'm preferring to capture it as a note first because it makes my notes more future-proof - if I want to add some thoughts on said organisation/person/book, I can do this and have it automatically plugged in / linked to my other notes via [[bi-directional linking|bi-directional linking]].
