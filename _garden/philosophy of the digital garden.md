# My philosophy of digital gardens

I think a [[digital garden|digital garden]] is a very personal endeavour - everyone will have different motivations for it (e.g. [[digital garden motivations|here are mine]]).

In the process of creating [[My Digital Garden (Home)|mine]], I'm forming some principles / guidelines for myself that feel right.

- [[Don't overthink what you're writing|Don't overthink what you're writing]]
- [[Produce half-baked notes|Happily leave things which are half-baked]]
- [[Demonstrating a garden changing over time|Demonstrate change]]
- [[Eschewing the evergreen|Eschewing the evergreen]]
