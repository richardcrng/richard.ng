# My philosophy of digital gardens

I think a [[digital garden|digital garden]] is a very personal endeavour - everyone will have different motivations for it (e.g. [[digital garden motivations|here are mine]]).

In the process of creating mine, I'm having some surprising thoughts!

## Don't overthink what you're writing

My normal writing process involves lots of thought and backspacing ("oh that actually could be worded better").

When I'm writing my digital garden, I'm actively trying to avoid backspacing - seeing it as a random dump of ideas in my head, almost like stream of consciousness.

This makes it less reader friendly (hence the need for a [[digital garden - field guide for visitors|field guide]], probably) but it's actually quite a nice writing experience.

So, is it selfish? Undoubtedly - but [[digital garden motivations|I'm doing this mostly for myself]], anyway, so that seems totally appropriate in this instance.

## Happily leave things which are half-baked

In the early stages of my digital garden, I'm leaving a lot of notes that are incredibly half-baked - to be generous!

Lots of them are actually placeholder notes. (See: [[What will you encounter in my digital gardenï¼Ÿ|my ontology of digital garden notes]])

This helps me [[drawing connections|draw connections]] more easily, which is a very satisfying endeavour - just spew the notes out as atoms, and focus on the connections rather than the atoms themselves.
