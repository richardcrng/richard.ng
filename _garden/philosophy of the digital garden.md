# My philosophy of digital gardens

I think a [[digital garden|digital garden]] is a very personal endeavour - everyone will have different motivations for it (e.g. [[digital garden motivations|here are mine]]).

In the process of creating [[My Digital Garden (Home)|mine]], I'm having some surprising thoughts!

## Don't overthink what you're writing

My normal writing process involves lots of thought and backspacing ("oh that actually could be worded better").

When I'm writing my digital garden, I'm actively trying to avoid backspacing - seeing it as a random dump of ideas in my head, almost like stream of consciousness.

This makes it less reader friendly (hence the need for a [[digital garden - field guide for visitors|field guide]], probably) but it's actually quite a nice writing experience.

So, is it selfish? Undoubtedly - but [[digital garden motivations|I'm doing this mostly for myself]], anyway, so that seems totally appropriate in this instance.

## Happily leave things which are half-baked

In the early stages of my digital garden, I'm leaving a lot of notes that are incredibly half-baked - to be generous!

Lots of them are actually placeholder notes. (See: [[What will you encounter in my digital gardenï¼Ÿ|my ontology of digital garden notes]])

This helps me [[drawing connections|draw connections]] more easily, which is a very satisfying endeavour - just spew the notes out as atoms, and focus on the connections rather than the atoms themselves.

## Demonstrate change

[[digital garden|Digital gardens]] are all about change, in my book.

This is very different to a traditional blog post which is by and large assumed to be unyielding and static.

As I'm building my digital garden, I'm trying to design ways to clearly demonstrate the evolution of notes, e.g.:
- [[GitHub|GitHub]] contribution-style heatmaps to show activity
- changelog of recent [[git|git commits]]

(and I'm finding these things enormously [[satisfying to build|building stuff]])

## Eschewing the evergreen

[[evergreen notes|Evergreen notes]] are an appealing concept.

I deliberately work under a "non-evergreen" mindset, though (which I think is more to do with terminology of 'evergreen' rather than the actual definition).

For me, the term 'evergreen' has connotations of 'should always be green (i.e. full of vitality and bloom)', whereas my digital garden is explicitly [[publicising unfinished notes|full of things which are short stubs]].

This is important for me to consciously adopt as a principle because it overcomes my [[perfectionism]].

[[Maggie Appleton|Maggie Appleton]] has [a taxonomy of notes](https://maggieappleton.com/evergreens):
- seedlings
- budding
- evergreen

which I'm attracted to, partly because it could also serve a nice way of [[declaring epistemic status and effort in a digital garden|declaring epistemic status and effort]] for each note, as suggested in [[Shawn Wang|Shawn Wang]]'s [Digital Garden Terms of Service](https://www.swyx.io/digital-garden-tos/) (which I'm intending to base [[digital garden - field guide for visitors|my own garden field guide]] off).

(It's also, clearly, a lovely thematic fit with 'digital garden' and 'evergreen' notes!)
