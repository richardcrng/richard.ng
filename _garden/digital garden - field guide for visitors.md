# Digital Garden - Field Guide for Visitors

This digital garden is probably unlike most things you've visited on the web:
- it's not primarily been built for an audience
- it includes lots of content that is subject to high change

I don't expect it to be user friendly for people who aren't myself.

At some point, when it's more developed, I'll try to give a more useful field guide (and it will live here!).

Until then, a good starting point might be [[Shawn Wang|Shawn Wang]]'s [Digital Garden Terms of Service](https://www.swyx.io/writing/digital-garden-tos/).
