# Software engineering education

I've [[my career path|ended up falling into]] a niche of coding education thanks to my experience in [[education|education]] and [[edtech|edtech]].

In the field, I've observed that there aren't many people who can straddle these two dual fields of software engineering and education to be genuinely good coding educators.

Just as [[software engineering|software engineering]] is a craft, [[teaching as a craft|so is teaching]] - and there isn't necessarily loads of overlap between the two.

It's a big problem because it plays into the  [[impostor syndrome|impostor syndrome]] and [[diversity and inclusion|diversity problems]] in tech - where novices ascribe difficulty to [[the self-perception barrier to learning coding|"I don't have the right brain for this"]] when the biggest contributor might actually be poor advice / materials / guides.
