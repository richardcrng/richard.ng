Michael Sandel is one of the people I admire most - as an [[education|educator]], a [[philosophy|philosopher]] and a [[citizenship|citizen]].

## As an educator

He is a remarkable educator, as you can see (and benefit from) in his Harvard MOOC *[[Michael Sandel's Justice MOOC|Justice: what's the right thing to do?]]*:
- a fantastic practitioner of the [[Socratic method|Socratic method]]
- a generous ability to draw out wisdom from *anything* which a student says
- delivering with wonder and awe even theories he disagrees with

It is that exact MOOC which originally made me consider studying [[philosophy|philosophy]] (ultimately leading me onto studying [[PPE|PPE]] at [[the University of Oxford|Oxford]]).

## As a philosopher

I'm becoming [[changing opinions|increasingly persuaded by]] ideas of [[communitarianism|communitarianism]], of which Sandel is a leading proponent.

I remember coming across one of his papers whilst doing some library reading in my undergraduate degree. At the time, I felt a lot of affinity with [[Rawlsian liberalism|Rawlsian liberalism]] - an idea which Sandel himself had delivered so compellingly in his [[Michael Sandel's Justice MOOC|Justice MOOC]]! - and yet, [in this paper](), he was critiquing it:

> What is denied to the unencumbered self is the possibility of membership in any community bound by moral ties antecedent to choice; [s]he cannot belong to any community where the self *itself* could be at stake.

At the time, I remember reading this and feeling both perplexed and resentful that this philosopher role model of mine could stake out a stance against the [[political philosophy|political philosophy]] of John Rawls, which spoke to me so strongly - particularly doing so in a way that I couldn't understand, intuit or articulate.

Revisiting it now, several years later, I am struck by my totally opposite reaction - I am profoundly struck:
- I am personally quite affected by this sensation of having been on a rather large political journey
- I think the point itself is rather profound - both as a critque of [[Rawlsian liberalism|Rawlsian liberalsim]] but also as a general point on [[identity|identity]]
- most of all, he diagnoses a society plagued by contemporary individualism - and in coming to see he is right, I realise how deep some of our social ills are
