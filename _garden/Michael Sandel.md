Michael Sandel is one of the people I admire most - as an [[education|educator]], a [[philosophy|philosopher]] and a [[citizenship|citizen]].

## As an educator

He is a remarkable educator, as you can see (and benefit from) in his Harvard MOOC *[[Michael Sandel's Justice MOOC|Justice: what's the right thing to do?]]*:
- a fantastic practitioner of the [[Socratic method|Socratic method]]
- a generous ability to draw out wisdom from *anything* which a student says
- delivering with wonder and awe even theories he disagrees with

It is that exact MOOC which originally made me consider studying [[philosophy|philosophy]] (ultimately leading me onto studying [[PPE|PPE]] at [[the University of Oxford|Oxford]]).

## As a philosopher

I'm becoming [[changing opinions|increasingly persuaded by]] ideas of [[communitarianism|communitarianism]], of which Sandel is a leading proponent.
