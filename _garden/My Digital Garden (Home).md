# Welcome to my Digital Garden!

This is the home page for my [[digital garden|digital garden]] - thanks for visiting!

There's some visitor caution advised: [[What will you encounter in my digital gardenï¼Ÿ|lots of the stuff in this garden is incomplete]].

[[digital garden motivations|I have been inspired]] to create a [[digital garden|digital garden]] to help me to distill my thoughts (even when unfinished) and [[learning in public|learn in public]].

In doing so, this liberates me to put down content that is finished.

So, please be prepared to see all of the unfollowing:
- fragmented thoughts that are not well-formed
- tentative opinions that [[changing opinions|could get radically changed]]
- passages of text that are randomly incomplete
- links to random notes that don't exist, [[example private note|like this example private note]]

Please be aware that I am deliberately not spending loads of time and thought on making this user-friendly - this garden is here if you fancy going through the weeds, but I'm not trying to provide a map; it's up to you how you navigate it!
