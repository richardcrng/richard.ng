# Welcome to my Digital Garden!

I have been inspired to create a [[digital garden|digital garden]] to help me to distill my thoughts (even when unfinished) and [[learning in public|learn in public]].

In doing so, this liberates me to put down content that is finished.

So, please be prepared to see all of the unfollowing:
- fragmented thoughts that are not well-formed
- tentative opinions that could get radically changed
- passages of text that are randomly incomplete
