# Welcome to my Digital Garden!

This is the home page for my [[digital garden|digital garden]] - thanks for visiting!

## What's a digital garden?

If you're not familiar with the idea of a digital garden, I recommend you start with [[Maggie Appleton's Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden|this lovely illustrated guide]] by [[Maggie Appleton|Maggie Appleton]].

As you're exploring, please take caution - [[What will you encounter in my digital gardenï¼Ÿ|lots of the stuff in this garden is incomplete]]! (I am working on a [[digital garden - field guide for visitors|field guide]], but it is - perhaps ironically? - not finished.)

## Where should I visit?

A good place to start might be reading about [[digital garden motivations|my broad motivations/goals]] for this space.

You should also [[digital gardens that I like|look at other digital gardens that have inspired me]].

More broadly though,

## How did you (or how can I) build this?

If you want to know how I produce this digital garden, check out [[My digital garden workflow|this note]].

If you're interested in building your own, [[Building your own digital garden|I want to talk to you]]!
