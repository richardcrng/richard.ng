# Welcome to my Digital Garden!

This is the home page for my [[digital garden|digital garden]] - thanks for visiting!

There's some visitor caution advised: [[What will you encounter in my digital gardenï¼Ÿ|lots of the stuff in this garden is incomplete]].

I'm working on a [[digital garden - field guide for visitors|field guide]], but it's nowhere year finished yet (like a lot of stuff in this garden!).

A good place to start might be reading about [[digital garden motivations|my broad motivations/goals]] for this space.

You should also check out some digital gardens that have inspired me:
