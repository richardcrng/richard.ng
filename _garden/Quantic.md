Quantic offers a mobile-first MBA. I enrolled because I was pretty curious about what this offered as a learning experience.

I think the tech isn't massively sophisticated, but I was pretty impressed with how engaging it was as an experience, particularly because it wasn't much more than a textbook - albeit one broken down into small chunks with frequent interaction, but relatively simplistic interaction.

I ended up withdrawing because I didn't have enough time with everything else I was doing (e.g. building an interactive mobile-first learning experience of my own with [[Included M|Included M]]!).
