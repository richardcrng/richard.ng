# GitHub

GitHub is where I host lots of my code (as is industry-standard), [[@richardcrng|@richardcrng]].

I remember finding [[git|git]] quite difficult to learn when I first started - nobody explained the mental model to me and it's not obvious to work out - but I think I've developed quite a good one now.
