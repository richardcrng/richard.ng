title: Bruno Arine's digital garden
---

I am a big fan of the way that Bruno introduces [his digital garden](https://notes.brunoarine.com/):

> Brains should be public domain. Our ideas derive from other people’s ideas, which derive from yet others’ ideas, and so on. [Every useful idea is a remix](https://notes.brunoarine.com/posts/20200924182258-every_useful_idea_is_a_remix/). The creative process doesn’t begin with a blank slate, and this is why neither the corpus of human knowledge nor none of its building blocks should be kept private. Thus, I am publishing online my **digital garden** of personal notes.

> This website is supposed to be a work in progress for as long as I live. It is my online second brain, an ever-changing garden of highly interconnected nodes that mimics the topology of relevant ideas in my mind.

This speaks to some thoughts I have on [[a digital garden as a second brain|a digital garden as a second brain]].
