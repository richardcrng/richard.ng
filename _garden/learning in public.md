# Learning in public

**Learning in public** is about publicising what you are learning, as you are learning it.

Most people find it counter-intuitive. I think the rationale is often along the lines of:

1. if you are in-the-process of learning something, you are imperfect at it
2. it hurts you if other people learn your imperfections about something
3. therefore, you hurt yourself by publicising your learning

I think these are outweighed by the following considerations:

- we're never finished learning, so if you never learn in public, you never share anything...
- relatedly, the alternative to learning in public is often absence of public presence - i.e. demonstration of zero competencies as opposed to demonstration of partial competencies

There are some other thoughts shared e.g. in [Andy Matuschak's 'Work with the garage door up'](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu)
