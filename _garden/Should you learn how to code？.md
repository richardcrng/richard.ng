# Should you learn how to code?

I'm sometimes asked about [[how to learn how to code|the best ways to learn how to code]].

But, of course, there's a prior question - *should* I learn how to code? - which I am asked about *less*.

Some things that fly around in this debate:
- [[software is eating the world|the observable growth of tech and predicted mass-displacement via automation]] (and therefore learn how to code or get eaten)
- [[no code|no code tools]] which mean it's not necessary to learn how to code

Some things which I think need articulating more:
- [[skills for the future|the future of skills is not just technical]] - it's also deeply human and interpersonal skills
- [[building stuff|coding is fun]]! There are, imo, good intrinsic reasons to learn.

My general opinion is:
- almost everybody *could* learn how to code
- I can't reasonably give a blanket answer as to whether a given person *should* learn how to code
- but I think the answer is *plausibly, yes, it would be a worthwhile investment for you to learn at least **some** coding* for a significant proportion of people.
