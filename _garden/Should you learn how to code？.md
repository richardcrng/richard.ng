# Should you learn how to code?

I'm sometimes asked about [[how to learn how to code|the best ways to learn how to code]].

But, of course, there's a prior question - *should* you learn how to code?

Some things that fly around in this debate:
- [[software is eating the world|the observable growth of tech and predicted mass-displacement via automation]] (and therefore learn how to code or get eaten)
- [[no code|no code tools]] which mean it's not necessary to learn how to code

Some things which I think need articulating more:
- [[skills for the future|the future of skills is not just technical]] - it's also deeply human and interpersonal skills
