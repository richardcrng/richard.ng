# Venture Capital

I was one of the inaugural Fellows of [[Included VC|Included VC]] (and am now alumni, I guess, if that's the term? I still describe myself as a Fellow although I don't know if that's technically accurate...).

My interest in VC stems from:
- love of [[startups|startups]] (specifically early-stage)
- an interest in [[scaling impact|scaling my impact]]

I've also found that it has provided me with some interesting mental models that I now apply to other parts of my life - for example, [[the fund returner mental model|I apply the fund returner mental model to how I think about projects and people]].
