# Demonstrating a garden changing over time

[[digital garden|Digital gardens]] are all about change, in my book.

This is very different to a traditional blog post which is by and large assumed to be unyielding and static.

As I'm building my digital garden, I'm trying to design ways to clearly demonstrate the evolution of notes, e.g.:
- [[GitHub|GitHub]] contribution-style heatmaps to show activity
- changelog of recent [[git|git commits]]

(and I'm finding these things enormously [[satisfying to build|building stuff]])
