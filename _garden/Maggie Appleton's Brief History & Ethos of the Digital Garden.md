If you're looking to get started in understanding [[digital garden|digital gardening]], [this piece](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) by Maggie is an *extraordinarily* good piece.

2. Digital gardens are on-trend! Lots of really interesting people are looking at them, which is maybe a sign that [[Building your own digital garden|you should be, too]]
