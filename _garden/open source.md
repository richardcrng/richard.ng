# Open Source

I try to **open-source** (e.g. making source code publicly available) my work whenever possible, for a few reasons:

1. *Culture* - the culture of open-source appeals to me (building off others' work, letting others build on your work)
2. *Visibility* - open-sourcing work makes it easier for your work to get noticed (related to [[learning in public|learning in public]])
3. *Accessibility* - I'm not in the business of jealously guarding what I've learned; I like helping others

I haven't yet open-sourced the code for this website yet, mostly for security reasons - I have one repository which has this website's source code *and* my personal Obsidian notes. I plan to make most of these notes public, but I'm keeping it closed-source until I'm sure that I am happy to make *all* of them public.

However, I definitely plan on making a *recipe* publicly available for 'how I built this'.

(You might see some note links which go to private notes - like [[example private note|this one here]] - dotted around)
