# A digital garden as a second brain

Some people write about digital gardens as second brains, e.g. Bruno Arine explicitly introduces [[Bruno Arine's digital garden|his digital garden]] as an "online second brain".

[[My Digital Garden (Home)|My own digital garden]] isn't my second brain - yet. There's still lots I need to add to it. But I am intending it to hold lots of my thoughts.

For those interested more in the idea of notetaking and 'second brains' [[Tiago Forte|Tiago Forte]]'s [[Forte Labs|Forte Labs]] has a course: [[Building a Second Brain|Building a Second Brain]].
